## Features We Could Really Use

* Check for 'ab' binary and if not present, install or complain
* Notice things like return code for ApacheBench: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31789614/how-to-verify-ab-responses
* More host data collection - fold output samples into a file tagged with platform, hostname, etc.
* Data processing from that output format - variance, percentiles, etc.
* Packer build for image, for preinstalled Nokogiri on all Ruby versions, etc.

## Things to Productively Benchmark

* App server - is WEBRick making a difference here?
* Number of warmup iterations
* Concurrency of requests
* ApacheBench vs RestClient vs benchmark-ips vs others?
* JRuby, maybe others like TruffleRuby or Rubinius
* ApacheBench with -k option for HTTP keepalive, multiple requests/connection
* Try out Locust? https://locust.io
* Try out Ruby-JMeter gem? https://github.com/flood-io/ruby-jmeter / https://flood.io/blog/load-testing-a-restful-api-with-ruby-jmeter/
