## Bugs

* Packer build isn't getting wrk into /usr/local/bin properly on Ubuntu
* Lots of error messages to console - need to fix w/ wget and server disconnect
* Automatically show error rate after benchmark run

## Features We Could Really Use

* Packer build for image: preinstall gems on all Ruby versions

## Things to Productively Benchmark

* App server
* Number of warmup iterations
* Concurrency of requests
* JRuby, maybe others like TruffleRuby or Rubinius
