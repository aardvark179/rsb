## Bugs

* rvm_batching runner doesn't handle nested keys (wrk, override)
  properly

## Features We Could Really Use

* Go through other app servers, get list of gem dependencies, include
  in BenchLib
* Packer build for image: preinstall gems on all Ruby versions
* SQlite in-memory setup
* Automatic Gemfiles for "unremarkable" Ruby versions that only
  include Gemfile.common. How to handle Gemfile.lock?

## Things to Productively Benchmark

* App server
* Number of warmup iterations
* JRuby, maybe others like TruffleRuby or Rubinius
