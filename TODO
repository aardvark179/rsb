## Bugs

* Packer build isn't getting wrk into /usr/local/bin properly on Ubuntu
* Bump WRK_CONCURRENCY default above 1 in RVM runner - that's a terrible
  default. Research WRK's concurrency and exactly what it controls.
* Standardize field names for JSON vs env vars (e.g. runs vs batches)
* Document (somewhere) the diff between user-specified fields and
  the options array taken by the runner

## Features We Could Really Use

* Packer build for image: preinstall gems on all Ruby versions
* SQlite in-memory setup
* Automatic Gemfiles for "unremarkable" Ruby versions that only
  include Gemfile.common. How to handle Gemfile.lock?

## Things to Productively Benchmark

* App server
* Number of warmup iterations
* JRuby, maybe others like TruffleRuby or Rubinius
