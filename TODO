## Features We Could Really Use

* More host data collection - fold output samples into a file tagged with platform, hostname, etc.
* Data processing from that output format - variance, percentiles, etc.
* Packer build for image, for preinstalled Nokogiri on all Ruby versions, etc.

## Things to Productively Benchmark

* App server - is WEBRick making a difference here?
* Mac vs Ubuntu
* Rails vs plain Rack
* Number of warmup iterations
* Concurrency of requests
